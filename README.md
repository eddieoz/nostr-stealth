# Nostr-Stealth (proof-of-concept)

## Introduction

Nostr-Stealth is a cutting-edge encryption method built on top of the Nostr protocol, specifically designed to ensure sender and receiver metadata full anonymity. Leveraging the concept of channels (or mixers), Nostr-Stealth ensures that individual messages between users cannot be distinguished or differentiated, thus enhancing user privacy.

## Features

1. **Metadata Encryption:** Sender and receiver metadata is securely encrypted to ensure complete anonymity.
2. **Channel Mixer:** The destination for each message is always the channel. By design, this ensures the real receiver remains undiscoverable.
3. **Ephemeral Keys:** Every message sent uses ephemeral keys, ensuring that tracking a message back to its sender becomes an impossible task.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v18
- Npm (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eddieoz/nostr-stealth.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd nostr-stealth
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Usage
1. **Preparation**:
   - Copy `env-sample` to `.env`
   - Add private and public keys for the sender, receiver and channel in `hex` format.
     - The channel privkey is optional for this example
   - Add a relay address

2. **Set Up Channel**:
   - The channel is a valid public key. Create a pair of valid keys and update .env (CHANPRIV is optional, because it can't decrypt messages)

3. **Sending Messages**:
   - $ node publish.js "your-message"
   - Write your message and hit send. Your metadata will be encrypted and mixed with others in the channel.

4. **Receiving Messages**:
   - node receive.js
   - The last message for you within the channel will be displayed.

5. **Note**: For best security practices, it's recommended to regularly switch channels.

    Actor A
    Participant C as Channel
    Actor B
    note over A,B: share the Channel pub
    note over A,B: share and register Apub, Bpub
    note left of A: create ephemeral keys
    note left of A: encrypt(Apriv, Bpub, message)
    note left of A: create event kind 4
    note left of A: encrypt (Apriv, Bpub, json(event))
    note left of A: create event kind 1337
    note left of A: getSignature(event1337, ephemeralPrivkey)
    note left of A: relay.publish(event1337)
    A->>C:send event to channel
    C-->>A:successful
    B-->>C:monitor events kind 1337
    C->>B:new message
    note right of B: Tests decryption of a message for [Apub,...]
    note right of B: (success) decrypt kind 4 event 
    note right of B: manage kind 4 event
```
## Security Precautions

- While NostrStealth enhances metadata security, always ensure you're on a secure and trusted network when communicating. Use VPN or Tor to obfuscate your IP address.
- It is preferreable to not share channel IDs on public platforms. But more people using the same channel, it improves privacy.
- Regularly rotate and use new channels for different communications to ensure optimal privacy.
